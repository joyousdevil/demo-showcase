âš  This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Info

__I created this portfolio website to learn more about making a more modern, fluid, and intuitive user experience.__ I would like to extend the greatest thanks to *Takuya Matsuyama* aka __[@craftzdog](https://github.com/craftzdog)__ for the video he posted on how to make a site such as this.

Used in this project:
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org), the React framework for production. NextJS gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org), a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), a utility-first, open-source CSS framework used to rapidly build modern websites.
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org), a JavaScript tool that transforms CSS code into an abstract syntax tree, providing an API for analyzing and modifying CSS using JavaScript plugins.
- [Embla Carousel](https://www.embla-carousel.com), a lightweight carousel library with fluid motion and great swipe precision.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), a free and open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.
- [Icons8](https://icons8.com/), free UX design elements with clients such as Apple, Microsoft, and Uber.


## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i

# or

yarn
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or

yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
